# Farm2Home

Farm2Home is a full-stack e-commerce platform designed to connect farmers directly with consumers, eliminating intermediaries in the sale of vegetables, fruits, and other farm products. This project aims to empower farmers by allowing them to list and manage their products independently while providing consumers with fresh, locally sourced produce.
